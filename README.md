# Embedded Intelligence: An AI-Powered Learning Assistant for Technical Documentation

This repository contains the development of an AI-powered knowledge assistant that helps users navigate technical documentation using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The project is being built over a structured 10-week plan and explores technologies like LLMs, vector databases, LangChain, and Streamlit ‚Äî with a focus on applications in technical enablement, onboarding, and knowledge management.

## üìå Project Goal

To build a hands-on RAG-based prototype that:

- Retrieves relevant knowledge from technical documentation
- Generates contextual, verifiable responses using LLMs
- Adds learning-focused features like guided flows, concept linking, and embedded knowledge hygiene tips
- Demonstrates how modern AI tools can support documentation-driven learning at scale

---

## üß± Tech Stack (WIP)

- **Language:** Python
- **LLMs:** Azure OpenAI / OpenAI GPT-4
- **Vector DB:** ChromaDB (local), Pinecone (cloud), or Azure Cognitive Search
- **Frameworks:** LangChain / LlamaIndex
- **Interface:** Streamlit or Gradio
- **Other:** Docker, GitHub Actions, RAGAS (evaluation)

## üîç Use Case

This assistant is designed to help technical and non-technical employees ‚Äî especially new hires ‚Äî quickly locate relevant information across sprawling internal documentation repositories (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint, GitHub wikis), while offering embedded micro-learning and support.
